VERSE
G              G
I'm just a man
   C 
I understand the wind
    D 
And all the things
              G
That make the children cry

G              
With my Les Paul
  C
I know I'm small
    D
But I enjoy living
      G
Anyway
G
Book after book
        C
I get hooked
Everytime the writer
         G
Talks me like a friend

CHORUS
G
What can I do
        
We just live in a zoo
All I do is play
                 G
The spaceball ricochet

VERSE
G
Deep in my heart
          C
There's a house
That can hold
       G
Almost all of you

I bought a car
       C
It was old but kind

I gave it my mind
And it disappeared

I love a girl
She is a changeless angel
She's a city it's a pity
That I'm like me

CHORUS
I said how can I lay
When all I do is play
The spaceball ricochet
```
