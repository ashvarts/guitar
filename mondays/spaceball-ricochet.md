# Spaceball Ricochet by T-Rex
```
VERSE
G              
I'm just a man
    C 
I understand the wind
    D 
And all the things
                G
That make the children cry

G              
With my Les Paul
    C
I know I'm small
    D
But I enjoy living
  G
Anyway

G
Book after book
        C
I get hooked
                D
Everytime the writer
          G
Talks me like a friend

CHORUS
G
What can I do
                  C
We just live in a zoo
                D
All I do is pla-ay
                 G
The spaceball ricochet

VERSE
G
Deep in my heart
           C
There's a house
          D
That can hold
       G
Almost all of youz

G
I bought a car
       C
It was old but kind
   D         
I gave it my mind
        G
And it disappeared

G
I love a girl
           C
She is a changeless angel
         D
She's a city it's a pity
       G
That I'm like me yeah

CHORUS
G                 G
I said how can I lay
           C             D
When all I do is plaaa-aay
                 G
The spaceball ricochet
