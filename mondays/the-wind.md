# The Wind by Cat Stevens
```
I listen to the wind

To the wind of my soul

Where I'll end up, well, I think

Only God really knows
G        A           G  A    D      
   I've sat upon the setting sun
Em        G        Em       G  A4 A
     But never-ne ever-ne  ver-ne-ver

I never wanted water once

No, never, never, never
I listen to my words
But they fall far below
I let my music take me where
My heart wants to go
I swam upon the devil's lake
But never, never, never, never
I'll never make the same mistake
No, never, never, never
```
